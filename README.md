# s02170203
Repo for practical .NET programming 2020 tasks (student account s02170203)
In samples you can find test Program.cs & folder with images.
In developing I used onnx model resnet152-v2-7 (https://github.com/onnx/models/blob/master/vision/classification/resnet/model/resnet152-v2-7.onnx).
This onnx model file is too large to add it in repository. I added resnet34-v1-7.onnx instead. It's smaller and works 2x faster, but recognition results should be worse.
